# Getting Started

## Java Preview Features

This gradle project has Java preview features enabled. However, your IDE
requires additional configuration to correctly compile the code. If using
VScode, execute the `./gradlew eclipseJdt` task, which will perform necessary
configuration for you. For other IDEs, see
https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/671.
